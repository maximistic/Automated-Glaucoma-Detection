# Automated-Glaucoma-Detection

##Objectives:
  * Focuses on the Development of an Automated method for glaucoma detection using Deep learning techniques.
  * Specifically DenseNet model.
  * To create a scalable and efficient solution capable of analyzing retinal images to play a pivotal role in the early detection of glaucoma.
  * Utilized LIME explainable AI to provide interpretability to the predictions made by the model.

##Features:
  * Training a DenseNet model with Chakshu Dataset
  * Including Optimization techniques to the Trained Densenet model to improve the Performance Metrics.
  * Using LIME to provide explanations to the predictions of the model.
